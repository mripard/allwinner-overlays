The NTC 4.4 kernel for the CHIP supports loading automatically
overlays through the DIP spec, but also supports manually loading some
through an interface based on the configfs virtual filesystem.

In order to apply such an overlay, first compile it using the Makefile
provided. You should end up with a *.dtbo file. Copy that file to the
CHIP.

Then, we should make sure that configfs is properly mounted.

mount -t configfs none /sys/kernel/config

We can now advise the kernel that a new device tree is going to be
applied:

mkdir /sys/kernel/config/overlays/sample

And now, we can apply the overlay

cat sample.dtbo > /sys/kernel/config/overlays/sample/dtbo


If you want to remove it later on, simply remove the directory you
created:

rmdir /sys/kernel/config/overlays/sample
